[[The Ribbon Programming Language]]

### A Decade-Long Detour


This is the story of how I ([noxabellus](https://noxabell.us)) arrived at the foundational design principles within Ribbon. My goal is to give you insight into the technical decisions behind it, and to ground them; not as abstract choices, but as solutions to concrete problems I have faced.

My journey with this design began nearly a decade ago, born from a deep appreciation for extensible software. I started by studying established open-source languages, initially captivated by [[Lua & Luau|Lua]]. The ideas I found in [[Terra]], however, were world-changing for me. They brought back the golden age of [[LISP]]-like metaprogramming and solidified my view of programming languages as powerful toolkits.

But even with [[Terra]]'s incredible freedom, I found myself wanting more; specifically, more control. I was working on projects where I needed to run untrusted, user-submitted code, and my attempts to build sandboxes for my [[Terra]]-based extensions were easily escaped. Its power was its weakness in this context. It’s worth noting that at the time, [[Lua & Luau|Luau]] hadn't yet open-sourced their fantastic, gradually-typed, and sandboxed version of [[Lua & Luau|Lua]], which would have been a game-changer. I was facing a problem: how do you give users immense power without exposing the system to chaos?

This challenge became a core motivator. While I deeply respect the languages that inspired me, and I believe good community management is the first line of defense against exploits, I felt there was room for a different approach. I wanted to ease the security burden on both developers and end-users. So, with several years of prototyping already behind me, I decided to go back to the drawing board and dive deep into academic research.

My focus turned to type systems, and I crawled through hundreds of papers. Many of the most profound insights I found were either written by or referenced the authors of the [[Koka]] programming language, which became another major source of inspiration. My goal was to synthesize these modern academic ideas with the toolkit approach I'd grown to love, while staying true to my imperative, performance-focused roots in game development.

The result of that deep dive is a language where you can piece together a [[Domain Specific Languages|DSL]] in minutes, from either side of the embedded line, with a high degree of safety.

Ribbon's component design: lightweight, composable, and built on simple, structured allocations; is deeply inspired by [[modern C programming methodologies]]. I drew particular influence from the work of [Ryan Fleury](https://www.rfleury.com/), the philosophy of the [Our Machinery](https://ruby0x1.github.io/machinery_blog_archive/) team (RIP), and the principles embodied by [[Zig]]. This gives Ribbon a minimal runtime, often requiring only a few megabytes of memory for a Fiber to execute. For host-side code, this design offers incredible performance. Using the Ribbon C API, you get near-metal speed, but it also means you could easily cause a segfault if you're new to memory management in C.

This created the central dilemma: I wanted that raw performance for host code, but for guest code, often written by programmers new to an ecosystem, that level of risk was unacceptable. The divide between guest and host code needed to be minimal for efficiency and to make it easy to graduate trusted extensions into the core application, but the safety guarantees had to be worlds apart.

The solution, as it often does, came from making implicit programmer knowledge explicit in the type system. In Ribbon, the type system tracks what allocator every region of memory belongs to. A pointer's type includes a reference to the allocator that owns the memory it points to. This is similar in spirit to how [[Rust]] annotates references with lifetimes, but the mechanism is much simpler. By focusing on the allocator's lifetime instead of individual value lifetimes, Ribbon can perform these annotations entirely through standard type inference, with no need for manual annotation or complex borrow-checking algorithms.

So far, this gives us static guarantees about where pointers can point. To use this for safety, we rely on another key feature: [[Algebraic Effects]] tracking. When any region of memory is accessed, the type system tracks this as a side-effect. This allows you to communicate and statically check memory access patterns, which is invaluable in real-time applications like game engines. It helps developers pack data efficiently, avoid cache misses, and reason about performance in a way that’s often left to runtime profiling.

This approach deliberately makes different trade-offs than a system like [[Rust]]'s borrow checker. It prioritizes developer ergonomics and provides explicit control when performance is paramount, getting out of your way when you know what you're doing. It doesn't, by itself, prevent all memory errors like use-after-free or out-of-bounds access. However, it makes the implicit explicit, which is the first and most important step.

My primary concern for Ribbon's safety was ensuring guest code cannot access memory it wasn't given permission to. When compiling guest code, we can statically enforce this. We simply disallow unsafe casts and pointer arithmetic. Combined with the allocator and effect tracking, it can be statically proven that guest code only touches the memory it's supposed to.

This journey also led me to realize that the right execution method depends on the use case. For a public modding API, you can compile guest code with runtime checks that intercept every memory access, either through the [[Bytecode VM]] or by dynamically inserting machine code. For an internal tool written by a trusted developer, you can compile it with all checks disabled for maximum speed. This flexibility extends to data marshalling; you can safely pass data between Ribbon and your host without complex serialization, because for guest code, we can always verify where a pointer came from and whether it has permission to be there. You can even intercept memory access events to build your own virtual address spaces, a setup that is straightforward to implement with Ribbon's [[Toolkit API]].

Ribbon is the culmination of this journey. It’s a language designed to be a powerful, high-performance systems language for hosts, and a safe, robust, and easy-to-use extension language for guests, all within a single, unified framework.
